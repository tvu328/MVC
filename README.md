## Credits


I follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. I use the express-handlebars (Links to an external site.) package to use Handlebars.js for my Views, I used the MySQL2 (Links to an external site.) and Sequelize (Links to an external site.) packages to connect to my MySQL database for my Models, and I created an Express.js API for my Controllers.
